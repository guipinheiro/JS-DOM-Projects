# Learning basic JS specially with DOM interaction

Hello everyone!

In this repo, I will be following [this Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4aFq5-91M&t=2778s) in order to learn a bit more about JavasCript.

So, I was following FreeCodeCamp JS Learn Path, starting with basic JS operations (mathematical operations, loops, lists, creating objects, functions etc.), then it followed ES6 new syntax and some stuff involving OOP (which I'm currently learning so every lesson I had to stop, search for the topic, digest it and then see how ES6 made it more efficient). Now it's Regex time.

After that, I got a little tired of not being able to see the power of JS in action, specially interacting with users and the website it self. Thus, in order to keep me on track, I've searched for some JS tutorials with practical projects. Hope you find this repo useful.
